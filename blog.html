                    <div class="line-left">
                        <p>Why do people leave their homes and voyage all over the globe? The reasons why people love to travel are varied. They’re also very personal. 
					   Take a look at these motivations, and see which ones ring true for you.
					</p>
					<p><b>Challenging yourself:</b> You might feel like you’re stuck in a rut in your daily life. Or you’re yearning for something exciting and different. 
					      You’re craving new experiences and new challenges. Travel is the ideal place to test yourself. It pushes people to their limits and gets them outside their comfort zone.
					</p>
					<p><b>Learning:</b> Learning is a strong reason why people love to travel.  They want to experience something unfamiliar and leave with new skills or knowledge.
					</p>
					<p><b>Expanding your perspective:</b> Another reason why people love to travel: it helps open your mind. 
					      You realize that there’s no one way to live life. Meeting people from other places will show you that your world view isn’t the same as everyone else’s.
					</p>
					<p><b>Getting in touch with yourself:</b> Getting away from home gives you the opportunity to reflect on your life. You have the needed time and space to let your mind wander and take stock. 
						  Traveling is one of the best ways to learn more about yourself.
					</p>
					<p><b>Appreciating your life:</b> Exploring another place will give you a fresh appreciation for your hometown, country and “real life.” 
					      Once you’re back, you’ll feel lucky to live where you do. You’ll see that there really is no place like home.
